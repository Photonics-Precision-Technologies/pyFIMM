# pyFIMM
A Python Interface to PhotonDesign's FimmWave/FimmProp software.
Interface based off of Peter Beinstman's CAMFR simulation software.
Created by Jared F. Bauters & Demis D. John at the University of California, Santa Barbara, 2011

pyFIMM provides a CAMFR-like interface, in python, to construct, simulate and plot photonic devices in FimmWave.  This also enables one to do additional analysis on the simulations in python itself.
